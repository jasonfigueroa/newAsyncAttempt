# About This Project

This is a very minimal project that I would like to keep as simple reference for:
1. Modular JavaScript development using Browserify.
2. Basic implementation of AJAX.
3. Basic uses for jQuery.
4. The magical line needed to prevent a page refresh on enter when a text input is focused.

For the data I'm using [https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/).

To run the project locally:
1. clone the repo
2. run `npm install`
3. run `grunt`
4. run `http-server`
