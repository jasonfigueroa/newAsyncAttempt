# About This Project

This is a very minimal project that I would like to keep as simple reference for:
1. Modular JavaScript development using Browserify.
2. The database module (db.js) has a basic implementation of AJAX.

For the data I'm using [https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/).

To run the project locally:
1. Clone the repo
2. run `npm install`
3. run `grunt`
4. run `http-server`
